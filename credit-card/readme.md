Credit Card Number (with number formatting)
Expiration Date
CVV Number
Checkbox "Store the card", if this checkbox is selected - user is prompted to input his email under next input:
Email (only visible if user selects Store the card)
Submit button
Scenarios:
All fields are required, if a user keeps some field blank, those fields should be marked with errors
Credit Card Number, CVV, Expiration Date, Email need to have respective validations
Once the form is submitted, show a preloader for 2 seconds, after that show Success message
Please don't use existing solutions on the internet.

usability of the credit card form
